## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "warpgate_target" "web_server" {
  name        = "web-server"
  description = "Web server target"

  http_options {
    url = "https://web.example.com"
    tls {
      mode   = "Required"
      verify = true
    }

    external_host = "web.example.com"  # Optional
  }
}

resource "warpgate_ticket" "ticket" {
  username = "admin"
