# WarpGate Terraform Provider

The WarpGate provider allows Terraform to manage [WarpGate](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate) resources. WarpGate is a smart SSH and HTTPS bastion designed to enhance access management for your infrastructure.

This provider enables you to manage users, roles, targets (SSH, HTTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL), credentials, and access controls in WarpGate using Terraform.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    warpgate = {
      source  = "warp-tech/warpgate"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "warpgate" {
  host  = "https://warpgate.example.com"
  token = var.warpgate_token

  # Optionally disable TLS while connecting to Warpgate
  # Required only for self-signed certificates
  insecure_skip_verify = true
}

# Create a role
resource "warpgate_role" "developers" {
  name        = "developers"
  description = "Role for development team members"
}

# Create a user
resource "warpgate_user" "eugene" {
  username    = "eugene"
  description = "Eugene - Development Lead"
  
  credential_policy {
    ssh = ["Password", "PublicKey"]
  }
}

# Add a password credential to the user
resource "warpgate_password_credential" "eugene_password" {
  user_id  = warpgate_user.eugene.id
  password = var.user_password
}

# Add a public key credential to the user
resource "warpgate_public_key_credential" "eugene_key" {
  user_id    = warpgate_user.eugene.id
  label      = "Work Laptop"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

# Create an SSH target
resource "warpgate_target" "web_server" {
  name        = "web-server"
  description = "Production web server"
  
  ssh_options {
    host     = "10.0.0.1"
    port     = 22
    username = "admin"
    public_key_auth {}
  }
}

# Assign the role to the user
resource "warpgate_user_role" "eugene_developer" {
  user_id = warpgate_user.eugene.id
  role_id = warpgate_role.developers.id
}

# Assign the role to the target
resource "warpgate_target_role" "developers_web_access" {
  target_id = warpgate_target.web_server.id
  role_id   = warpgate_role.developers.id
}
```

## Authentication

The WarpGate provider offers a way to authenticate with the WarpGate API using a token. This token can be provided in the provider configuration or via the environment variable `WARPGATE_TOKEN`.
